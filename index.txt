    <h2>Who is a QA Engineer?</h2>
    <p>This is the specialist who first comes to mind when it comes to testers. They look for bugs and errors, compiles lists
    of identified problems so that developers can fix them, and checks whether the product meets the meets the requirements.
    At the same time, a QA Engineer never fixes bugs, but only reports what needs to be changed and improve.</p>
